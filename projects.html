        <h2>KTH Racing</h2>

        <p>
        Together with an amazing team of people, I played a small role in designing and constructing the R10E, an FSAE formula racing car.
        I developed an innovative aerodynamics package with high focus on ground effects and high-downforce features, developing massive downforce at relatively low speeds.
        </p>

        <p>Here is a short excerpt from an article about the KTH Racing project (now KTH Formula Student), showing the rendered car.</p>

        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>
            <h5>Aerodynamic design</h5>
            <p>
            The package utilized an aggressive diffuser, large underbody air intake, a lower single-element rear wing and a large dual-element upper rear wing, as well as a small front wing.
            </p>
            <p>
            The ground effects
            accounted for more than 50% of the total downforce, with the rear wings not only providing independent downforce, but also playing
            a crucial role in total underbody effects.
            </p>
            <p>
            At top speeds, downforce should have exceeded weight.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Construction</h5>
            <p>
            The vehicle was fully constructed at competition, but sadly the powertrain was not fully completed in time.
